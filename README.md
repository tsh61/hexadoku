# hexadoku
A hexadoku (a 16-by-16 sudoku, with hexadecimal digits) solver. Takes a partially completed puzzle and fills in blank spaces, maintaining the usual rules of sudoku (each digit is unique to its row, column, and subgrid; each row, column, and subgrid have all hexadecimal digits from 0 - F). Additionally, returns an error message if the given puzzle is unsolvable.
